Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
        reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
        efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
        scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
        security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    Software Crisis & Structured Programming (1968) – Introduced at the NATO Conference to address project failures, leading to structured programming and Waterfall methodology.
    Agile & DevOps (2001-Present) – Agile Manifesto emphasized flexibility; DevOps improved collaboration, automation, and delivery speed.
    AI & Automation (Present & Future) – AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) enhance coding, testing, and software quality.
    
    Mastering Complexity
    Solutions: Modular programming, OOP, microservices to break down large systems.

    Mastering Process
    Solutions: Agile, DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, project management tools for efficiency and automation.
    
    Mastering Machine
    Solutions: High-level languages, compilers, cloud computing for easier and scalable software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    Planning – Defines project goals, feasibility, and resources needed.
    Requirement Analysis – Gathers and documents software needs.
    Design – Creates system architecture and user interface plans.
    Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and compile code.
    Testing – Identifies and fixes bugs to ensure quality.
    Deployment – Releases the software for users.
    Maintenance & Support – Updates, fixes, and improves the software over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, implements features, and fixes bugs.
    Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software for defects, ensures quality, and automates test cases.
    Project Manager: Oversees project scope, deadlines, and team coordination to ensure timely delivery.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA): Provide code editing, debugging, and build automation tools, enhancing developer productivity.
    VCS (e.g., Git, SVN): Tracks code changes, facilitates collaboration, and enables rollback to previous versions.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Scope Creep: Use clear requirements and Agile methodologies.
    Technical Debt: Prioritize refactoring and maintain clean code.
    Collaboration Issues: Utilize communication tools (Slack, Jira).
    Debugging Complex Issues: Use logging, debugging tools, and peer code reviews.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    Unit Testing: Tests individual components (ensures functions work as expected).
    Integration Testing: Checks interaction between components (ensures smooth communication).
    System Testing: Tests the complete system (validates overall functionality).
    Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets business/user requirements before deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
